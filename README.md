# StonksSim
## Overview

The Stock Simulator is a Python-based program that allows users to engage in a virtual stock market environment, enabling them to buy and sell fake stocks from real companies. By leveraging the Yahoo Finance API, the simulator provides users with up-to-date and accurate market data, offering an engaging and educational experience for anyone interested in learning about stock trading and investment strategies. To enhance user experience, the project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the stock market data in an easily digestible format.
